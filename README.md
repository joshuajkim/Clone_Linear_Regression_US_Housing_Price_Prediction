# Clone_Linear_Regression_US_Housing_Price_Prediction

Linear Regression is the simplest algorithm in machine learning, it can be trained in different ways. In this notebook we will cover the following linear algorithms:

1. Linear Regression
2. Robust Regression
3. Ridge Regression
4. LASSO Regression
5. Elastic Net
6. Polynomial Regression
7. Stochastic Gradient Descent
8. Artificial Neaural Networks

We are going to use the USA_Housing dataset. Since house price is a continues variable, this is a regression problem.

The data contains the following columns:

* Avg. Area Income: Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
* Avg. Area House Age: Avg Age of Houses in same city
* Avg. Area Number of Rooms: Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
* Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
* Area Population: Population of city hou se is located in
* Price: Price that the house sold at
* Address: Address for the house
